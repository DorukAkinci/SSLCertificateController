# SSLCertificateController
You can easily check all of your server SSL certificates with this tool. Expired certificates and unexpected certificate thumbprint responses considered a problem. The application must be configured before starting. "App.config" file is used for configurations.

2 Types of check can be done.


> AddressCheck - Can be used for only a simple URL's SSL certificate check.

> CUSTOM - Can be used for group of servers. You can check servers with using their ip adresses while using host header to get the URL's SSL certificate.

Examples are shared within App.config file.
